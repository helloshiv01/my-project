# üìåReact 3D Model Viewer

This is a interactive React application that showcases the usage of the React Three Fiber and React Drei libraries to display 3D models in a web browser.Three.js is a powerful JavaScript library for creating 3D models in the browser.The project allows users to explore 3D objects and materials through an interactive and immersive experience.

**React.js**

**React Three Fiber**

**React Drei**

**Three.js**

## Features:
1)Realistic 3D models: The app features a variety of high-quality 3D models of engineering components that accurately simulate real-world materials and textures.

2)Lighting and shadows: The app uses advanced lighting techniques to create realistic shadows and highlights, adding depth and dimensionality to the 3D models.

3)User interaction: Users can interact with the 3D models through intuitive controls such as click, drag, and swipe, allowing them to explore the models from different angles and
perspectives.

4)Customizable options: The app includes customizable options such as changing the color of specific models or adding new models, allowing for greater flexibility and customization.

5)Web-based platform: The app is web-based, making it accessible from any device with a web browser, without the need for any additional software or downloads.

6)Cross-browser compatibility: The app is designed to be compatible with all modern web browsers, ensuring a consistent experience for all users.

7)Optimized performance: The app is optimized for fast and smooth performance, even on low-end devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Steps and Approach To Solve The Task
1.To Display CAD files on browser make react app using ```npx create-react-app my-project``` This will create a react app in directory.

2.Install three.js packages using ```npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei``` These Packages will help to display 3d objects in browser.

3.Converted the .stl/.stp/.igs/.brep file to a format that Three.js can read such as GLTF, using a CAD viewer or converter.

4.Imported the converted GLTF file into my React application using the useGLTF hook provided by ```@react-three/drei```

5.Used the useFrame hook provided by react-three-fiber to animate the 3D objects by changing their position, rotation, and scale over time.

6.Used the OrbitControls component provided by ```@react-three/drei``` to allow users to interact with the 3D scene by rotating, zooming, and panning the camera.

7.Used other components provided by ```@react-three/drei``` such as Environment and Sparkles to add special effects and visual enhancements to the 3D scene.

8.Deployed my React application to a hosting service such as Netlify.

## Deployed Appüòé
The app is deployed on Netlify and can be accessed using the following URL: https://iitb-task.netlify.app//

## Running the App Locally
1.Clone the repository using git clone

2.Navigate to the project directory using cd

3.Install the necessary dependencies using npm install

4.Start the development server using npm run start

5.Open ```http://localhost:3000``` in your web browser to view the app
